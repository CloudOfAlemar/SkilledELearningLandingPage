### What I learned

Hello everyone! I had lots of fun doing this challenge and I was tempted to use CSS Grid but I wanted to see if I could create the grid portion with flexbox instead. The most difficult part for me was deciding how I wanted the layout to look in between the breakpoints ( for example: like at 500px, 900px, etc... ). So I had to make some decisions but I hope you all enjoy my Solution.
